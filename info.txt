1. media files (uploaded by users)
    you can store files
    1) locally
    2) using custom file storage system (for example aws service)
2. relationships in models (3 models)
    blank and null the diff?
    NULL is db-related
    BLANK is validation-related (just about forms)
        a good practice to for string values to have empty string as a "null value"
            Avoid using null on string-based fields such as CharField and TextField. 
            If a string-based field has null=True, that means it has two possible values for “no data”: 
            NULL, and the empty string. In most cases, it’s redundant to have two possible values for “no data;” 
            the Django convention is to use the empty string, not NULL. 
            One exception is when a CharField has both unique=True and blank=True set. 
            In this situation, null=True is required to avoid unique constraint violations when saving 
            multiple objects with blank values.
